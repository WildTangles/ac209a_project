For district-level information, of particular interest were two observations, of the number of votes and the total number of votes cast for each candidate per district per state per year.

The ACS is primarily available in two formats: 1-year estimates and 5-year estimates. The main trade-off between these two formats is currency vs. precision of estimates. Compare to the 1-year estimates, the 5-year estimates are collected over a longer range of time and computed using a larger sample size, reducing the margin of error. The trade-off is that the 5-year estimates are less current than the 1-year estimates, which can be problematic for regions experiencing rapid changes. As a rule of thumb, the Census Bureau recommends using the 5-year estimates when analyzing smaller populations, where precision is more important, while the 1-year estimates may be better utilized for analyzing larger populations. Also, since our problem is primarily a predictive one rather than inferential, we decided that using more current data for each year was more important.\n",

Unfortunately, while this web interface is intuitive to use, it only allows access to the most recent 2017 data.

Also, the list of available characteristics would change year-to-year, so we had to find ones that were common across all years (even though they have slightly different names!).

        "District borders are not constant. Changes in district borders are rarely neutral. In most states, district borders are drawn by the state legislature. As a result, census districts are usually drawn with specific political goals in mind (i.e., to favor the party in power). Thus, understanding changes in district borders is important for predicting elections. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two cases when the borders of districts change: 1) every 10 years, the entire country draws new borders to reflect  changes in population distribution (this occurred between 2010 and 2012) and 2) if a state’s borders are declared illegal by the courts, their districts must be redrawn, even though population remains constant. \n",
        "\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, our model makes the assumption that District IDs are always correlated with the same population of people from year to year. However, this assumption is flawed. There are three ways a district can change between years: 1) the borders may change, 2) the district may move to an entirely new location within the state, such that it represents none of the same people, or 3) the district may cease to exist or start to exist (this case only happens every 10 years based on population change). All 3 of these cases were common in our dataset. More than 14% of our districts experienced redistricting throughout our study period, most of them between 2010 and 2012 when almost every district was redrawn. \n",

        "### Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "If the borders of a district changed, we used a “population-weighted average” of the data we wished to impute:\n",

        "$$ x_{current} = \\sum_{1}^{435} w_i  x_{prev} $$ \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "$$ w_i = \\frac{A_{overlap}}{A_{current}}  \\frac{1}{A_{prev}}  $$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $A_{current}$ is the area of the current year’s district, $A_{prev}$ is the area of the previous year’s district, and $A_{overlap}$ is the overlap between the current district and the old district. $\\frac{A_{overlap}}{A_{current}}$ represents the percentage of the new district’s area which comes from the old district. $\\frac{1}{A_{prev}}$ represents the population density of the previous district. Given that each district has ~711,000 inhabitants, this is an acceptable approximation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "<br />\n",
        "\n",
        "This data was then used in three ways:\n",
        "1. *To impute the margin of victory when redistricting occurred.* <br />\n",
        "If the district moved entirely, we wanted this to be reflected in the “previous winner” and “previous winner margin” predictors. We imputed the previous winner where the area of the district was changed by more than 10% by area. \n",
        "2. *To impute demographics data to pre-2010 years.* <br /> \n",
        "Since we only had 5 election years of demographics data, we were limited to using just 4 elections to train our model. Imputing demographics data backward allowed us to use the full 8 years of FEC data along with some reasonable estimates of demographics. \n",
        "3. *To drop districts where redistricting had occurred.*<br /> \n",
        "We tested this approach, but it was difficult to determine its success. For 2018, it involved dropping the entire state of Pennsylvania. It was hard to tell if our predictions really improved, or if we had just removed a “swing state” for which we already had poor predictions. Thus, it is not included in this report. \n"

        "On the front of the modelling, it would be more appropriate to consider architectures that more faithfully replicate representations in the real world. This could again take several directions. Notice below, a plot of the geographical location of districts that flip between 2010-2016. It's clear that not all states are 'created equal' in the context of flipping districts. For example, the larger states (California, Florida, Texas, etc.) are typically very likely to contain a district that flips. Interestingly, it seems that there are also many states where we expect to see no districts flipping at all. It appears that flips are typically relatively clustered geographically. An example of how this could be accomplished would be to use a KNN model that identifies nearest neighbors by geographical distance.\n",

        "At the outset of the project, we naively hoped to create a model which would predict the 2018 elections with a high accuracy score. We soon learned that no matter what datasets we threw at the model, all of them were insufficient to create a model with a better *accuracy score* than our baseline model. Instead, we refocused our efforts to create a model which had more realistic *probabilities* on the outcome. This probabilistic model of the 2018 elections allowed us to use the information we had while also acknowledging the limitations of our data. \n",

        "\n",
        "We found a way to **address redistricting** without the comprehensive demographics data used by FiveThirtyEight. By estimating the percent of population which moved from one district scheme to the next using the overlap of district boundaries, we found a tolerable way to impute prior election data. \n",
        "\n",
        "The probabilistic models enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of how our models were working. In the end, we had only a few data points which were predicted with a high degree of accuracy but which were incorrect. \n",

        "\n",
        "Because only a small number of districts flipped (i.e., voted for a different party than they did last year), the model could be highly successful by predicting that all or almost all of the districts would flip. This is the classic problem of the imbalanced dataset. Although we tried upsampling the prior dataset, we could try changing our performance metric to something specifically designed to combat this problem, such as Cohen’s Kappa. \n",
        "\n",
        "We were also plagued by insufficient data, both in terms of the number of years the data covered, and the number of meaningful predictors we had available. One issue that we ran into repeatedly was that running a new model was a 5-minute problem... but cleaning a new dataset is a 5-hour problem! Fortunately, the solution to this problem with more data does not require any ingenuity, only time. The datasets which we believe would improve our model the most are *district-level polls*, *fundraising* data, and *demographics data*, including race & ethnicity, for the full time period on which we trained our model.
