The information can be summarised as either candidate-level information (e.g. names of candidates) and district-level information (e.g. total number of votes). Candidate-level information such as campaign financing/scandals would have been interesting to consider and there is evidence that they are likely strong predictors of the outcome of a race (see fivethirtyeight). For district-level information, of particular interest were two observations, of the number of votes and the total number of votes cast for each candidate per district per state per year. From this information, we computed the winning candidate per district per state per year and by joining on the candiate-level information (party affiliations of candidates), we arrived at our response variable (winning party per district per state per year).\n",
